# Week 9 Assignment 
## A Midsummer Night's Dream Network Analysis 
The notebook in this repository is a copy of my Week 8 network analysis assigment. In the notebook, I import Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and split up the acts and scenes to be able to identify all the characters and which scenes they appear in together and how frequently. I then make my characters are nodes in a network and their appearances in scenes together as edges. From there, I visizulaize this network with a graph and clean uo the graph so that it is more readable. I also idenify the different communities of chatacters in the play.
